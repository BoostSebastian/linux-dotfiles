My Dotfiles for Linux Desktop
=============================

These are my dotfiles and general system preferences adapted for Debian-type Linux systems. This setup is intended for a personal development machine, not a web-facing server.

Linux Bootstrap Script
----------------------

This repo previously contained my entire provisioning solution for a new machine running Linux. I've now extracted the provisioning functionality into its own repository. Check it out:

&#9657; **Provision a new machine with [Linux Bootstrap](https://github.com/boostsebastian/linux-bootstrap).**

NOTE: Linux Bootstrap automatically clones and installs this dotfiles repo.


Prerequisites
-------------

The dotfiles assume you are running Ubuntu 14.04 (or similar) with the following software preinstalled:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* [Tmux](http://tmux.github.io/)
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)

All of the above and more are included in [Linux Bootstrap](https://github.com/boostsebastian/linux-bootstrap).

Installation
------------

```sh
git clone https://github.com/boostsebastian/linux-dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
source ~/dotfiles/install.sh
```


Post-install Tasks
------------------

After running `install.sh` there are still a couple of things that need to be done.

* Add personal data to `~/.gitconfig.local` and `~/.zshrc.local`.
